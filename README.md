<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![IGE Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/OniSensei/Intersect-GUI-Editor)

There are many great things about the Intersect Engine, and editing the GUI is not one of them. While I love that there is the ability and versatility to edit the GUI in such a way, it is slow and painstaking. You don't even know if what you're doing will look right until you load up the client. So I made this tool.

Here's why:
* Not everybody knows how to edit json files.
* Some people are more visual.
* Saving and loading to see edits is tiresome.

Of course, nothing is perfect and I will be trying to make it better with every chance i get! Feel free to contribute if you can!


### Built With

* [Treeview](https://github.com/zetoken/JSon-Editor/tree/master/JsonTreeView)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
* [Json.NET](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json)
